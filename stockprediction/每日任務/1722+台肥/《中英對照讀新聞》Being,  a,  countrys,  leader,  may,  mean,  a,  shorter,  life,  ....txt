Whether heads of government die prematurely is a long-debated question, and research has yielded conflicting results. For example, one study held that presidents might age twice as quickly as the overall American population while in office. Another study found no significant effect on the life expectancies of U.S. presidents.政府元首會不會早死，是個論辯不休的問題，研究也有不同的結果。比方說，一份研究主張，總統在位時，老化速度可能是美國整體人口的2倍。另一份研究則發現，對美國總統的平均餘命沒有重大影響。Now, the largest statistical study of its kind, examining elections held in 17 countries from 1722 to 2015, has found that elected heads of government lived 2.7 fewer years and experienced a 23 percent greater risk of premature death than the defeated office seekers.現在，這類研究中，最大的統計研究，檢視1722年至2015年17國舉行的選舉，發現當選的政府元首壽命少2.7年，早死的風險比競選失利者多23%。The analysis tested the hypothesis that elected presidents, prime ministers and chancellors experience accelerated aging and premature death because of the stresses of political life.這份分析測試當選總統、首相和總理，因政治生活壓力而加速老化以及早死的假說。The authors compared 279 elected heads of government with the 261 runners-up whom they defeated and who never served as heads of state. The researchers determined the number of years each competitor lived after the last election in which they ran, and compared the findings with the average life span for an individual of the same age and sex in each candidate’s country during the election year.作者比較279位當選的政府元首，和他們擊敗、從未當選國家元首的261人。研究人員判定每位競爭者在他們最後一次競選後活了幾年，並把結果和同一國、同年齡、同性別個人的平均壽命相比較。yield：動詞，產出，得出。例句：Favourable weather yielded a good crop.（好天氣帶來好收成。）hold：動詞，相信，確信。例句：Small amounts of alcohol are held to be good for the heart.（少量飲酒據信對心臟有好處。）significant：形容詞，顯著的，重要的。例句：There has been a significant increase in the number of women students in recent years.（近年來，女學生的人數顯著增加。）美國第32任總統富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福享壽63歲。（美聯社資料照）
